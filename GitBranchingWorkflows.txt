Git Best Practices

1. Don’t git push straight to master. Branch it out!
2. Write descriptive and meaningful commit messages.
3. Rebase your working branch frequently.
4. Test changes even when there are no conflicts.
5. Publish your changes.

 
Git Branching - Branching Workflows (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

Now that you have the basics of branching and merging down, what can or should you do with them? 
In this section, we’ll cover some common workflows that this lightweight branching makes possible, 
so you can decide if you would like to incorporate them into your own development cycle.

Long-Running Branches

You can keep doing this for several levels of stability. Some larger projects also have a proposed or pu (proposed updates) branch that has integrated branches that may not be ready to go into the next or master branch. The idea is that your branches are at various levels of stability; when they reach a more stable level, they’re merged into the branch above them. Again, having multiple long-running branches isn’t necessary, but it’s often helpful, especially when you’re dealing with very large or complex projects.

In reality, we’re talking about pointers moving up the line of commits you’re making. The stable branches are farther down the line in your commit history, and the bleeding-edge branches are farther up the history.

Topic Branches

You saw this in the last section with the iss53 and hotfix branches you created. You did a few commits on them and deleted them directly after merging them into your main branch. This technique allows you to context-switch quickly and completely — because your work is separated into silos where all the changes in that branch have to do with that topic, it’s easier to see what has happened during code review and such. You can keep the changes there for minutes, days, or months, and merge them in when they’re ready, regardless of the order in which they were created or worked on.
