Tasks 2020.01.18-22

Elementary
    6: "Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives him the possibility to
        choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n."
           - Consider when the user input is value is less than 1. It should not compute any operation.

    7: "Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12"
           - This is a little bit confusing, but your interpretation of printing the multiplication table is valid.
            If following this interpretation, then here is the complete multiplication table besides for number one (1)

    10: "Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years"

Lists - Strings

    4: "Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list."
            - Not wrong

    9: "Write a function that concatenates two lists. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]"
            - Not wrong

    11: "Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],
        [2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]. You can do this quicker than concatenating them
        followed by a sort"
            - Not wrong

    13: "Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers."
            -

    19: "Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a
        rectangular frame. For example the list ["Hello", "World", "in", "a",
        "frame"] gets printed as:
        *********
        * Hello *
        * World *
        * in *
        * a *
        * frame *
        *********"
            - Ok
